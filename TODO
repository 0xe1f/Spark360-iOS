! ImageCache'r considerably slows list scrolling. Improve performance
! MessageCompositionController crashes on simulated memory warnings
! Icons missing for game details bar icon (list, compare)
! Icons missing for live status

Compare:

* Add information on which side is whose on Compare Games, Achievements
* Design a nicer title display for Compare Games, Achievements

Messages:

* View: When message contains attachments, mention the the attachment types 
  in the viewer

Friends:

* Suppressed exceptions in FriendListController/configureCell cause rendering
  problems when friends list changes. Figure out a way to properly handle errors,
  and possibly redraw
* Add avatars to profiles

All:

* ProfileController will close view even if the incoming error has nothing to 
  do with invalid profile name. Filter notification types

Core:

* Change how ImageCache's notifications work - ImageCache shouldn't be setting 
  them - each controller should
* When images are downloaded, update single icon, not all (see imageSynced)
* Add network spinner when TaskControllerOp is in progress
* Delete database contents and keychain items when an account is deleted
