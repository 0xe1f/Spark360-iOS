Spark 360 for iOS
=================

Spark 360 was an Xbox Live client for iOS, based on the [original version for Android](https://github.com/pokebyte/Spark360) - it was available on AppStore for a span of a couple of months in 2012, but was eventually removed due to lack of interest. It was written to support iOS versions 3 and 4 - 4 being the latest version of iOS at the time.

Since I stopped working on the project, Xbox Live has changed substantially - enough to break the app completely.

Please note that **Spark 360 iOS is no longer maintained**. I'm largely providing it here with the hope that it may be useful to someone else.
